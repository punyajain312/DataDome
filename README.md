DataDo.me is an automated, end-to-end modular solution that makes the data cleaning and pre-processing tasks for your AI/ML applications a cakewalk. 

It implements hypertuned algorithms to detect and resolve duplicates, missing values, outliers, and type inconsistencies. It goes a step further and scales the data, encodes categorical values, and, even augments sparse or uniform datasets with distribution-aware synthetic samples, if needed.

### The Final Output:
A clean, consistent dataset optimized for high-performance analytics and model training.
